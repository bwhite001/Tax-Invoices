## üìñ Usage Guide

### Running Manually

1. Open your script at [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Select `extractInvoiceAttachments` from the function dropdown
3. Click **Run** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
4. Check execution log for results
5. Check your email for summary

### Testing with Limited Emails

Use the `testExtraction` function to process only 5 emails:

1. Select `testExtraction` from dropdown
2. Click **Run**
3. Review results before full processing

### Monitoring the Log Sheet

The "Extracted Invoices Log" spreadsheet contains:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Log Timestamp | When the file was extracted |
| Email Date | Original email date |
| Sender | Email address of sender |
| Subject | Email subject line |
| Attachment Name | Original filename |
| Attachment Type | File extension |
| Saved File Name | New filename in Drive |

**Tips:**
- Sort by date to find recent extractions
- Filter by sender to find specific vendors
- Use for tax preparation and audits

### Checking Your Google Drive

Files are organized as:
```
üìÅ Tax Invoices/
  üìÅ FY2024-2025/
    üìÑ 2024-12-15_vendor@email.com_invoice.pdf
    üìÑ 2024-12-20_supplier@company.com_receipt.pdf
  üìÅ FY2023-2024/
    üìÑ 2023-08-10_shop@store.com_bill.pdf
  üìä Extracted Invoices Log
```

### Managing Gmail Labels

The script creates these labels:
- **Invoices-Extracted**: All processed emails
- **Tax FY2024-2025**: Current financial year emails
- **Tax FY2023-2024**: Previous financial year emails

**To view labeled emails:**
1. Open Gmail
2. Look for labels in the left sidebar
3. Click to view all emails with that label

---

## üîß How It Works

### Workflow Overview

1. **Search Gmail**: Builds query with keywords and date filter
2. **Filter Emails**: Excludes already processed (labeled) emails
3. **Process Threads**: Iterates through email threads
4. **Extract Attachments**: Gets all attachments from messages
5. **Determine FY**: Calculates Australian Financial Year from email date
6. **Save Files**: Creates folders and saves with structured naming
7. **Log Details**: Records extraction in Google Sheet
8. **Apply Labels**: Adds "Invoices-Extracted" and FY-specific labels
9. **Archive**: Marks as read and moves to archive
10. **Send Summary**: Emails you the results

### Date Filtering Logic

The script only processes emails from the most recent tax period:

```javascript
// If today is after July 1, 2024: searches from July 1, 2024
// If today is before July 1, 2024: searches from July 1, 2023
```

This prevents reprocessing old emails while catching all current FY invoices.

### File Naming Convention

Files are renamed to: `YYYY-MM-DD_sender@email.com_originalname.ext`

**Example:**
- Original: `invoice.pdf`
- Renamed: `2024-12-15_accounts@vendor.com_invoice.pdf`

**Benefits:**
- Chronological sorting
- Easy sender identification
- Prevents filename conflicts
- Maintains original name for reference

### Duplicate Prevention

The script checks if a file already exists before saving:
- Same filename in same folder = skipped
- Prevents duplicate processing
- Logged as "File already exists, skipping"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Authorization required"
**Problem**: Script needs permissions
**Solution**: 
1. Run the script manually once
2. Follow the authorization prompts
3. Grant all requested permissions

#### "No emails found"
**Problem**: Search query returns no results
**Solution**:
1. Check your `searchKeywords` - are they too specific?
2. Verify emails exist with attachments
3. Check date range - emails might be too old
4. Look for the "Invoices-Extracted" label - emails might already be processed

#### "Execution timeout"
**Problem**: Script runs too long (6-minute limit)
**Solution**:
1. Reduce `maxEmailsPerRun` to 25 or less
2. Run multiple times to process all emails
3. Consider running more frequently (twice daily)

#### "Files not appearing in Drive"
**Problem**: Files saved but can't find them
**Solution**:
1. Check the "Tax Invoices" folder in Drive
2. Look in the correct FY subfolder
3. Search Drive for the filename
4. Check execution log for errors

#### "Duplicate files being created"
**Problem**: Same file saved multiple times
**Solution**:
1. Check if emails are being relabeled
2. Verify the "Invoices-Extracted" label is applied
3. Look for errors in the log

#### "Wrong Financial Year folder"
**Problem**: Files in incorrect FY folder
**Solution**:
1. Check the email date (not extraction date)
2. Verify Australian FY logic (July-June)
3. Manually move files if needed

### Checking Execution Logs

1. Open your script
2. Click **View** ‚Üí **Logs** or **Executions**
3. Look for error messages in red
4. Check "Emails processed" and "Attachments saved" counts

### Getting Help

If issues persist:
1. Check the execution log for specific error messages
2. Verify all permissions are granted
3. Test with `testExtraction` function first
4. Review the CONFIG settings for typos

## üé® Customization Tips

### Adding More Keywords

```javascript
searchKeywords: [
  'invoice', 'receipt', 'tax invoice', 'bill', 'payment', 'statement',
  'purchase order', 'PO', 'remittance', 'credit note', 'quote'
]
```

### Excluding Specific Senders

Add to the search query in `buildSearchQuery()`:

```javascript
query += '-from:spam@example.com ';
```

### Changing the Trigger Time

Modify `createAutomationTrigger()`:

```javascript
ScriptApp.newTrigger('extractInvoiceAttachments')
  .timeBased()
  .atHour(9)  // Change to 9 AM
  .everyDays(1)
  .create();
```

### Processing Older Emails

Modify `getTaxPeriodStart()` to go back further:

```javascript
// Go back 2 years instead of 1
return new Date(year - 2, 6, 1);
```

### Adding Custom Metadata

Modify `saveAttachment()` to add more file description:

```javascript
file.setDescription(
  'From: ' + message.getFrom() + 
  '\nSubject: ' + message.getSubject() + 
  '\nDate: ' + emailDate +
  '\nExtracted: ' + new Date()
);
```

### Creating Multiple Folder Structures

Organize by sender instead of FY:

```javascript
function getOrCreateSenderFolder(parentFolder, sender) {
  const cleanSender = sender.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '_');
  return getOrCreateFolder(cleanSender, parentFolder);
}
```

### Running Multiple Times Daily

Create additional triggers:

```javascript
// Morning run at 9 AM
ScriptApp.newTrigger('extractInvoiceAttachments')
  .timeBased()
  .atHour(9)
  .everyDays(1)
  .create();

// Evening run at 6 PM
ScriptApp.newTrigger('extractInvoiceAttachments')
  .timeBased()
  .atHour(18)
  .everyDays(1)
  .create();
```
