## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** with PowerShell 5.1+
- **LM Studio** installed and running ([Download](https://lmstudio.ai))
- **16GB RAM** minimum (for AI model)
- **Mistral 7B** or compatible model loaded in LM Studio

### 2. Setup LM Studio

```powershell
# 1. Download and install LM Studio from https://lmstudio.ai
# 2. Open LM Studio ‚Üí Discover ‚Üí Search "Mistral 7B"
# 3. Download the model
# 4. Go to Developer tab ‚Üí Toggle "Status" ON
# 5. Enable CORS in settings
```

### 3. Organize Your Invoices

```powershell
# Create folder for current financial year
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "G:\My Drive\Tax Invoices\FY2024-2025" -Force

# Copy your invoice files into this folder
# Supported: PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, EML
```

### 4. Run the Script

```powershell
# Process current financial year (2024-2025)
.\Invoice-Cataloger-LMStudio.ps1

# Process a specific financial year
.\Invoice-Cataloger-LMStudio.ps1 -FinancialYear "2023-2024"

# Check environment only (no processing)
.\Invoice-Cataloger-LMStudio.ps1 -CheckOnly
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Process Current Year
```powershell
.\Invoice-Cataloger-LMStudio.ps1
```
This processes invoices in `FY2024-2025` folder by default.

### Process Previous Year
```powershell
.\Invoice-Cataloger-LMStudio.ps1 -FinancialYear "2023-2024"
```

### Process Multiple Years
```powershell
# Process last 3 financial years
@("2022-2023", "2023-2024", "2024-2025") | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Processing FY$_..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
    .\Invoice-Cataloger-LMStudio.ps1 -FinancialYear $_
}
```

### Environment Check
```powershell
# Verify setup without processing files
.\Invoice-Cataloger-LMStudio.ps1 -CheckOnly
```

## üìä Output Files

The script generates three files in the `Processed` folder:

### 1. Invoice_Catalog_[timestamp].csv
Detailed list of all processed invoices with:
- Vendor information (name, ABN)
- Invoice details (number, date, amounts)
- Expense category
- Deductible amount
- Claim method and notes
- Required documentation

### 2. Deduction_Summary_[timestamp].csv
Summary by expense category:
- Total invoices per category
- Total invoiced amount
- Total deductible amount
- Average deduction

### 3. Invoice_Catalog_[timestamp].xlsx (if Excel installed)
Professional Excel workbook with:
- **Summary Sheet**: Category breakdown with totals
- **Invoices Sheet**: Detailed invoice list
- Formatted and ready for your accountant

## üè∑Ô∏è Expense Categories

The system automatically categorizes expenses:

| Category | Examples | Deduction Method |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Electricity** | Power bills | 60% work use (Actual Cost) |
| **Internet** | NBN, broadband | 60% work use (Actual Cost) |
| **Phone** | Mobile plans | 60% work use (Actual Cost) |
| **Software & Subscriptions** | GitHub, Azure, IDEs | Immediate (<$300) or Depreciation (>$300) |
| **Computer Equipment** | Laptops, monitors | Immediate (<$300) or Depreciation (>$300) |
| **Professional Development** | Courses, training | 100% deductible |
| **Professional Membership** | IEEE, ACM | 100% deductible |
| **Office Supplies** | Stationery, desk items | 60% work use |
| **Mobile/Communication** | VoIP, Zoom, Teams | 60% work use |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the script to customize settings:

```powershell
# Work from home configuration
WorkFromHomeDays = 3        # Days per week working from home
TotalWorkDays = 5           # Total working days per week
WorkUsePercentage = 60      # Calculated as 3/5 = 60%

# LM Studio endpoint (if running on different machine/port)
LMStudioEndpoint = "http://192.168.0.100:1234/v1/chat/completions"

# OCR settings
UseWindowsOCR = $true       # Use built-in Windows 10+ OCR
TesseractPath = "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
```

## üìã ATO Compliance Notes

### Work Use Percentage
- Based on days working from home: 3/5 days = 60%
- Applied to: Electricity, Internet, Phone, Office Supplies
- **NOT** applied to: Professional Development, Memberships (100% deductible)

### Depreciation Rules
- **Under $300**: Immediate deduction (same year)
- **Over $300**: Decline in value over effective life (2-4 years for computers)
- Use [ATO Depreciation Tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/calculators-and-tools/depreciation-and-capital-allowances-tool/)

### Record Keeping
Keep for **5 years**:
- ‚úÖ Original invoices/receipts
- ‚úÖ Generated CSV/Excel files
- ‚úÖ Bank statements showing payments
- ‚úÖ Time records (if using Fixed Rate Method)

### Alternative: Fixed Rate Method
Instead of Actual Cost Method, you can use:
- **$0.70 per hour** worked from home (2024-25 rate)
- Covers: Electricity, Internet, Phone, Stationery
- Requires: Detailed time records
- **Cannot** claim these expenses separately if using this method

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to LM Studio"
```powershell
# Check LM Studio is running
# Verify model is loaded (Developer tab)
# Test endpoint: http://localhost:1234/v1/models in browser
# Ensure CORS is enabled in LM Studio settings
```

### "Invoice folder not found"
```powershell
# Create the folder for your financial year
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "G:\My Drive\Tax Invoices\FY2024-2025" -Force

# Verify the path matches your Google Drive location
```

### "No files found to process"
```powershell
# Check files are in the correct folder (not subfolders)
# Verify file extensions are supported
# Ensure files aren't locked/in use
```

### "Model not responding"
```powershell
# Restart LM Studio
# Close other applications to free RAM
# Try a smaller model if memory constrained
# Increase timeout in script configuration
```
